# Syzkaller Bug Fixing Resources

This repo is designed to address the Linux Community's long-standing need to get syzkaller bugs fixed (literature 1: the tim bird presentation, literature 2: greg kh)
Longstanding coverage about fixing these bugs have been reported (LKML). Many passionate developers have tried but abandoned the project hitting a stumbling block,
funding towards fixing these bugs exist in the form of a kernel mentorship program (link here) exists -- but yet again all share a common downfall (? bad wording): 
there exist many valid approaches in which one could fix bugs, get started learning but cannot find a centralized technical resource as well as a developer
community for which new developers can begin to help themselves and overcome stumbling blocks. This repo is designed to solve the issues of 
information asymmetry surrounding fixing these syzbot bugs, as well as to help new developers learn their way around the kernel and its 
development culture

The documentation on the repo works more like an anthology -- oftentimes, many of these guides have long existed in an uncurated fashion. The sum of these guides build 
both on the existing efforts of others as well as to strengthen their impact by combining them.
